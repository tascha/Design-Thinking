Design thinking techniques and research methods can be used in a variety of ways. As a youth librarian, you can use these techniques to tackle your own challenges, or you might integrate design thinking methods as a framework for youth to help them use the techniques of a designer. You can use the entire design thinking process or elements of it in your work with youth. This section discusses integrating design challenges into your work.

One way to begin thinking and working like a designer is to explore the use of a “design challenge”. A design challenge is a way to initiate a project that allows you or your youth community to cycle through all elements of the design thinking process (d.school, 2016). Design challenges typically emphasize project-based learning. You can frame a design challenge to address administrative issues, space design, and services— exploring challenges both in the library context and across the greater community.

For instance, you might think about how youth can work together to solve real world issues such as creating a safe gathering space for youth, helping visitors of their city understand their community better, or assisting elders with using mobile technology. Projects may range in scope and scale. Perhaps your design challenge is more related to issues within your library such as integrating a new technology or demonstrating value to the local school system. Whatever you decide to tackle, use as much

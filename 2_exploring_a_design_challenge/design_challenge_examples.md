## Design Challenge Examples {#design-challenge-examples}

Here are a few simple design challenges that youth and librarians have tackled in other libraries across the US: (taken from interviews)

*   Youth at a rural Northeastern library collaborated with librarians to create videos for other teens and families to promote a summer reading program
*   In a CSI style programming event, youth at an urban Midwestern library were given a scientific mystery challenge and used problem solving and working in groups to discover the answers.
*   Teens and librarians at suburban East Coast library used the design thinking approach of brainstorming to address the challenge of booking their favorite musician for an event at the library. Together, they creatively came up with fun ways to celebrate their favorite musicians without spending a lot of money and resources.
*   A youth librarian at an urban library in the West used a design thinking process to tackle challenges he faced when his initial plan for a workshop wasnâ€™t working.

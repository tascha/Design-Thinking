### 3A. Imagine, ideate, iterate {#3a-imagine-ideate-iterate}

Read the following scenario:

_Zeynep is a librarian in a small, rural community. She wants to offer an engaging summer programming experience for the students in her town while they are out of school. She creates a bulletin board with sticky notes and asks students to write down things they’d like to see in a summer library program. She also pays attention to what young people enjoy doing around town, and what kind of topics they’re interested in when they visit the library. After collecting all the suggestions and observations, Zeynep begins to organize them into themes, mixing and matching program elements and thinking about which worked well together and were feasible for her library. She develops a few different versions of a summer program and gets feedback from other library staff as well as a few youth patrons and their parents. Finally, she develops a single plan for a program and begins to implement it._

Which activities fall under the “imagine” phase? Which comprise the “ideate” phase? When is iteration happening?
